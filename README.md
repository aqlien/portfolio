This app is intended to be used for my personal site.
The style uses Zurb's Foundation framework, and the general setup was based on [Railscast episode 417](http://railscasts.com/episodes/417-foundation?view=asciicast).

A preview of the site's current homepage follows:

This welcome page will change in the future.

I'm working on adding a blog post system, a preview of the current implementation follows:
![Blog Screenshot](https://github.com/aqlien/portfolio/blob/master/app/assets/images/readme/blog_screenshot.png)

Of course, a blog needs some kind of authentication in order to prevent everyone with the address from posting, so I'm working on adding one with the Devise gem.

###Sources:
The footer received some help from [CSS Sticky Footer](http://www.cssstickyfooter.com/using-sticky-footer-code.html).
